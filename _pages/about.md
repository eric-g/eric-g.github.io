I am a QA Engineer with over 10 yearsâ€™ experience as a key member of core software development teams.
I have expertise working to improve quality on a wide variety of projects spanning front and backend of mobile social
media apps, e-commerce and lead-gen platforms, web applications and proprietary support tools. I have proven success
designing and executing comprehensive test plans and automation development supporting features and
enhancements throughout the product development lifecycle.

I am a fierce advocate for quality with an action-oriented bias and excellent communication skills.
